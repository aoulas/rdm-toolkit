title: "Marine metagenomics"
---


## Description

John is an early career researcher who is writing his first grant to enable him to generate metagenomics (genome) from seawater in an area of suspected pollution.  He wants to find out how composition of species changed in the area of pollution. This is his first grant as a PI, and he is required by the funding body to write a data management plan (no more than 2 pages of text) to accompany his grant.  Ideally, he would like to see examples of what other researchers in the community have written, not only to be able to write the data management plan (DMP) but also so that he can cost data storage with University IT.  He doesnâ€™t know where to start.  From the guidance given by the funder, he knows he needs to consider data reuse and knows of a public repository but would like to see if there are others available.  He knows that for the duration of the project he must annotate datasets with appropriate metadata but does not know which metadata standard is appropriate.  He knows that at the end of the project, the data needs to be accessible by the public. The university in which he works does not provide a solution, so he would need to find an alternative.
